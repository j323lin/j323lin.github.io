    <h3>Flutter</h3>
    <p id="flutter_intro">
        Flutter is an open-source UI SDK created by Google for building natively compiled applications 
        for mobile(foldable devices too), web, desktop and embedded devices from a single codebase. 
        It allows developers to write applications using the Dart programming language.
    </p>
    <p id="flutter_perform"> 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Peformance:</span>
        Flutter has its own rendering engine Skia, which compiles the UI to native code. This compiling 
        ahead-of-time (AOT) results in excellent performance and rendering speed.
        It also allows for high-performance applications with smooth animations and transitions.
        Afterwards, Flutter transitioned to Impeller, which is designed to optimize GPU usage which leverages modern
        hardware for better user experiences.
    </p>
    <p id="flutter_platform">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Platform Support:</span>
        Flutter: Supports iOS, Android, web, and desktop,allowing developers to target multiple 
        platforms and audiences from a single codebase.
    </p>
    <p id="flutter_learning">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Learning Curve:</span>
        Requires familiarity with Dart programming language, which might have a steeper learning
        curve for developers new to it. But it is easier to learn than Javascript.
    </p>
    <p id="flutter_ui">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">UI Components:</span>
        Provides a rich set of customizable UI widgets following Material Design guidelines or Cupertino
        for Android and iOS. It also introduces the concept of themes 
        to share styles across pages and enables consistent UI across platforms. This is particularly developer friendly too.
    </p>

    <h3>React Native</h3>
    <p id="react_intro">
      React Native is a mobile framework based more was developed by Facebook. It utilizes APIs and native UI components to build mobile applications.
      React Native uses JavaScript as a bridge to create applications that run on both iOS and Android devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that React Native is different from 
      the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React project</a> 
      and ReactJS which is a JavaScript library.
    </p>
    <p id="react_perform">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Performance:</span>
        React Native relies on a bridge to communicate between JavaScript and native components,
        which can introduce some performance overhead, especially for complex animations.
        However, optimizations like Hermes can improve performance.
    </p>
    <p id="react_platform">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Platform Support:</span>
        React Native supports development for iOS, Andriod, web applications as well as applications for TV and watch devices.
    </p>
    <p id="react_learning">
      The learning curve can be quick if the developer is already familiar with JavaScript which is usually used in web development.
      So they might only have to learn React framework.
    <p id="react_ui">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">UI Components:</span>
      React Native is a mobile framework based more on native components for both Android and iOS devices. It offers a wide range of UI components and 
      third-party libraries that helps in creating beautiful user interfaces to build native-like user experiences in iOS and Andriod Devcies. 
    </p>
    <h3>PhoneGap</h3>
    <p id="phonegap_intro">
      PhoneGap, now known as Apache Cordova, is an open-source framework for building cross-platform mobile 
      applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Developed by Adobe Systems, PhoneGap allows
      developers to create mobile apps that can run on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone, using a single codebase.
    </p>
    <p id="phonegap_perform">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Performance:</span>
      Relies on a bridge that converts develoers' HTML, CSS, JavaScript code into native code via a consistent, cross-platform JavaScript API. 
      However this can result in slower performance compared to Flutter and React Native for complex applications.</p>
    <p id="phonegap_platform">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Platform Support:</span>
      PhoneGap can be used to develop for iOS, Andriod, web applications.
    </p>
    <p id="phonegap_learning">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Learning Curve:</span>
      Easy to learn the development environment if the developer is already fimilar with the 
      web technologies.
    </p>
    <p id="phonegap_ui">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">UI Components:</span>
      Relies on web technologies for UI rendering, providing access to standard HTML elements 
      and CSS styles for building user interfaces. It does not provide native UI components, 
      however, there are third-party frameworks (eg. Ionic) which provices pre-designed UI components and layouts 
      specifically tailored for mobile applications built with web technologies. This may require more efforts of 
      developer and development time.
